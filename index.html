  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>
    Cantilever is not just another tech conference — it’s a celebration of coding as a form of art. 
    Over three inspiring days, Cantilever brings together forward-thinking developers, designers, 
    and innovators to explore how technology can be more than lines of code: it can be storytelling, 
    performance, and creative expression. 
  </p>
  <p>
    From keynote talks to immersive workshops, Cantilever offers a unique space where creativity meets 
    technology. Whether you’re building your first interactive project or experimenting with generative 
    art and AI, you’ll find ideas, mentors, and collaborators here. Our goal is to empower you with 
    both the technical skills and the artistic mindset to see coding in a whole new light.
